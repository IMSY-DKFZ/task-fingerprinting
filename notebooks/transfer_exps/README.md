## Reproduction of Transferability Estimation Evaluation

All downstream experiments on top of neural network training can be reproduced via the instructions
given inside the "notebooks" folder. The evaluation only relies on a recent (and public) version of `mml`.
You need may use the same virtual environment as described in the recent experiments section.
